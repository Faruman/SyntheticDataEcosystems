# Cycle 1: Initial Design Principles
In the second cycle of the DSRM project, DP2 was refined by exploring various methods for synthetic data generation, addressing prior expert feedback. A systematic literature review identified algorithms like GANs, Gaussian mixture models, and variational autoencoders, which were tested on a financial fraud detection dataset. Privacy checks confirmed the safety of the generated data. The findings underscored the importance of combining synthetic and real data, leading to a new design principle (DP5) and an updated system architecture.
